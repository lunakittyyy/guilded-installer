# Try the flatpak FIRST! This is an alternative method if the flatpak is broken or you really need native packages.
# guilded-installer
A shell script to extract and install Guilded from its .deb

This bash script downloads Guilded's .deb package, extracts its contents, and puts the folders into their proper spots. This lets you install and integrate Guilded just like the .deb package does on distros that cannot use them (i.e. Arch, Fedora, etc.)

Tested on Fedora Workstation 36
